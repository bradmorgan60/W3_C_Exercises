This is a markup document that provides an overview of the heap data structure and the reasons why it is important.
Every data structure / algorithm in computer science exists for a reason, and there must be purpose with every exercise performed.

(in my own words)
The Heap Data Structure
The Heap is a region of memory responsible for dynamic memory allocation. In the C programming language, programmers are responsible for allocating, reallocating, deallocating, and freeing memory in their own programs.
If this is not performed correctly, the program is subject to data leaks and heap overflows...which could crash the program.

The exercises performed in this repository are for my own education on problem solving with the heap, as well as for discovering concepts and tools I can use in future or current projects.

The world is full of possibilities...and the C programming language enables me to dive into the world of engineering and technology. This is the part of my lifelong journey to becoming a great technologist.
