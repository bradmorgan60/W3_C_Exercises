This is a markup document that provides an overview of the heap data structure and the reasons why it is important.
Every data structure / algorithm in computer science exists for a reason, and there must be purpose with every exercise performed.

(in my own words)
The heap Data Structure
The heap is a region of memory responsible for dynamic memory allocation. This is important because since a program runs in Random Access Memory (RAM), memory address space is allocated to be able to run the program. As the program consumes memory with each function contained in the program, what happens to the memory for functionality that is not being used? If it is still consuming memory address space and is being unused, this can cause the program to fail since memory needed to run the program does not have enough capacity. This is why it is important to allocate memory when needed, and free it when it is not needed. C Programming enables this for the programmer, as this is a mid-level programming language. In contrast, a high-level programming language

In the C programming language, programmers are responsible for allocating, reallocating, deallocating, and freeing memory in their own programs.
If this is not performed correctly, the program is subject to data leaks and heap overflows...which could crash the program.

The exercises performed in this repository are for my own education on problem solving with the heap, as well as for discovering concepts and tools I can use in future or current projects.

The world is full of possibilities...and the C programming language enables me to dive into the world of engineering and technology. This is the part of my lifelong journey to becoming a great technologist.
